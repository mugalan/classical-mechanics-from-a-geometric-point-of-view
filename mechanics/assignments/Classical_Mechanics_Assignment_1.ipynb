        "In an interferometer, the pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen arises from interference between two beams of light that have traveled different optical paths. Each point in the pattern corresponds to a particular *phase difference* between the beams, but because light oscillates so rapidly, detectors cannot measure the *absolute* phase of the light wave — only the **intensity**, which depends on the cosine of that phase difference. As a result, a fixed optical path difference produces a stationary interference pattern, but the pattern itself does not reveal the absolute phase offset between the arms of the interferometer.\n",
        "\n",
        "What can be measured experimentally is a **change in the pattern** — that is, how many fringes shift position when the relative phase between the two beams changes. If one arm length or the orientation of the apparatus changes (as in the Michelson–Morley experiment), the overall optical path difference changes slightly, and the entire fringe pattern slides across the screen. The *total number of fringes* in the field remains the same — the pattern’s spacing and shape do not change — but its **position** shifts uniformly. The number of fringes that move past a reference point corresponds to the *change* in total phase difference between the two arms. Thus, interferometers measure **changes in phase**, not absolute phase, and Michelson–Morley’s famous “null result” meant that no such phase change occurred when the apparatus was rotated, implying that the speed of light is the same in all directions.\n",
