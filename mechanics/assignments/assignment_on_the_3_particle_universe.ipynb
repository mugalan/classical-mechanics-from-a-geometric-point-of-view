        "Consider the example of mutually interacting, but otherwise isolated, three particles $P_1, P_2, P_3$, each of mass $m_1,m_2,m_3$ respectively (a 3-particle universe). Note that the relative position between the particles may vary with time. Let $x_1,x_2,x_3$ be the representation of these three particles with respect to some inertial frame $\\mathbf{e}$. This also models the instance where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two particles of interest and $P_3$ represents the interaction that these two have with the rest of the universe. Use $f_{ij}$ to denote the force on $i$ due to its interaction with $j$ for $i,j\\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n",
