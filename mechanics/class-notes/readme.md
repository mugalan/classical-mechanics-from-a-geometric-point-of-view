This is a compilation of notes by D. H. S. Maithripala of the University of Peradeniya that originated as class notes for ME2204 Engineering Mechanics at the department 
of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna during the period of 2006 to 2008.  It is currently being used as supplementary notes for CE1010, ME211, ME320 and ME518 at the 
University of Peradeniya. They are far from complete and I will be frequently 
updating them as time permits.
I am deeply indebted to all the students who have suffered through them and have tried out the exercises and have provided me with valuable input. I am sure there are many errata 
and will greatly appreciate if you can please bring them to my notice by sending an e-mail to mugalan@gmail.com.
