        "Let us consider smooth rotations that are parameterised by a parameter $t$ that we may consider to be time. Let $R(t)$ be a smooth curve in the space $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ such that $R(0)=I_{3\\times 3}$. Then from the above discussion on the physical significance of $R\\in SO(3)$ we see that $R(t)$ represents a smooth rigid rotation of space for all $t$. Let $\\mathbf{b}(t)=\\mathbf{e}R(t)$ be the corresponding rotating frame. Since $R(0)=I_{3\\times 3}$ we see that $\\mathbf{b}(0)=\\mathbf{e}$. Let $P(t)$ be a point in space that corresponds to $P(0)$ being `rotated' by $R(t)$. That is if $X$ is the representation of the point $P(0)$ in the $\\mathbf{e}=\\mathbf{b}(0)$ frame then $R(t)X$ is the representation of the point $P(t)$ in the\n",

That is, the representation $X$ of the point $P(t)$ in the $\\mathbf{b}(t)$ frame will not depend on $t$. Let $x(t)$ be the representation of the point $P(t)$ in the $\\mathbf{e}$-frame. Then $x(t)=R(t)X$.\n",
