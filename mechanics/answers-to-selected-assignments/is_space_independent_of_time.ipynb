        "### 1. **Common Perception vs. Galilean Relativity**:\n",
        "   - The common perception is that space and time are independent: space is where events happen, and time tells when they happen, without any direct interplay between the two.\n",
        "   - In Galilean relativity, the relationships between the coordinates of space and time as seen by different inertial observers show that this separation is not as clear-cut as commonly perceived.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Space-Time Coordinates**:\n",
        "   - The observers $\\mathbf{e}$ and $\\mathbf{e}'$ are two Galilean inertial observers. Observer $\\mathbf{e}$ uses coordinates $(t, x)$, where $t$ is the time and $x$ is the spatial position, to describe an event. Similarly, observer $\\mathbf{e}'$ uses coordinates $(\\tau, \\xi)$ for the same event.\n",
        "   - The task is to find how these coordinates relate to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Transformation of Time**:\n",
        "   - The argument begins by asserting that time is homogeneous and intervals of time are invariant across inertial observers. This assumption leads to the conclusion that $\\tau = t + a$, where $a$ is a constant. This means that the time coordinates of the two observers differ only by a constant shift.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Transformation of Space**:\n",
        "   - The spatial coordinates are assumed to transform as $\\xi = \\beta t + R x$, where $\\beta$ is a constant matrix (representing a velocity vector) and $R$ is a constant matrix (representing a rotation or possibly a reflection).\n",
        "   - The homogeneity of space leads to this linear transformation, where the matrix $R$ must be orthonormal (i.e., $R^T R = RR^T = I$) to preserve the lengths and angles, as these should be invariant under a change of inertial frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Relative Velocity**:\n",
        "   - The key result here is that if you consider the origin of $\\mathbf{e}'$ as observed by $\\mathbf{e}$, the relative velocity between the two frames $v$ is constant. This is derived from the fact that $v = \\dot{o} = -R^T \\beta$, meaning the velocity vector $v$ does not change over time.\n",
        "   - Hence, the frames $\\mathbf{e}$ and $\\mathbf{e}'$ must be translating at a constant velocity with respect to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Galilean Transformation**:\n",
        "   - The final step is to express how the coordinates of an event in one frame translate to the other. The transformation $(t, x) \\rightarrow (t, R(x - vt))$ shows that space and time are intertwined: the spatial coordinates $\\xi$ in the frame $\\mathbf{e}'$ depend not only on the spatial coordinates $x$ in the frame $\\mathbf{e}$ but also on time $t$ and the relative velocity $v$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Conclusion**:\n",
        "   - The Galilean transformation $x' = R(x - vt)$ clearly demonstrates that spatial coordinates in one inertial frame depend on both the spatial coordinates and the time in another frame. Therefore, this transformation suggests that space and time are not entirely independent, as the common perception would have it. Instead, they are interconnected in the context of relative motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Summary**:\n",
        "This argument effectively shows that under Galilean relativity, space and time cannot be considered entirely independent. The transformation laws governing the relationship between coordinates in different inertial frames imply that spatial coordinates in one frame are influenced by both the spatial and temporal coordinates in another frame. Thus, the idea that spatial properties are independent of time is challenged, at least within the realm of classical mechanics and Galilean relativity."

        "  - In the $ \\mathbf{e}' $ frame, the coordinates are $(\\tau_1, \\xi_1)$.\n",

        "  - In the $ \\mathbf{e} $ frame, the second flash occurs at time $t = T$.\n",
        "  - Since $O'$ is moving with velocity $v$, the position of $O'$ at time $T$ is $x = vT$.\n",
        "  - Therefore, in the $ \\mathbf{e} $ frame, the coordinates of event $A_2$ are:\n",
        "    \\begin{align*}\n",
        "    x_2 = \\xi_2 + vt_2 = 0 + vT = vT\n",
        "    \\end{align*}\n",
        "  - So, in the $ \\mathbf{e} $ frame, $A_2$ is at $(t_2, x_2) = (T, vT)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Spatial Distance Between Events:\n",
        "- In the $ \\mathbf{e}' $ frame, both events $A_1$ and $A_2$ occur at the same spatial location, so the spatial distance between them is zero:\n",
        "  \\begin{align*}\n",

        "  \\begin{align*}\n",
        "  \\text{Spatial distance in } \\mathbf{e}: |x_2 - x_1| = |vT - 0| = vT\n",
        "  \\end{align*}\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "This example clearly demonstrates that the spatial distance between the two events $A_1$ and $A_2$ is zero in the frame $ \\mathbf{e}' $, but non-zero (and equal to $vT$) in the frame $ \\mathbf{e} $. This shows that the concept of spatial distance is not invariant under a change of inertial reference frames in Galilean relativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, the perception that spatial properties are independent of time is indeed incorrect, as this example illustrates how the spatial separation between two events depends on the relative motion between the observers. This dependence on the relative velocity $v$ indicates that space and time are interlinked, even in the realm of classical mechanics."
